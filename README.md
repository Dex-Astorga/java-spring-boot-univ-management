# java-spring-boot-univ-management
Managing CRUD requests from users to database using spring boot.

This project introduces a basic CRUD application focused on managing student data. It serves as a practical way to familiarize oneself with Java programming, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, PostgreSQL integration, and Spring Boot development. Notably, the application employs a create-drop database approach, ensuring a fresh start upon each launch, with two initial students pre-registered in the database table. This project provides an excellent opportunity to gain hands-on experience in essential technologies while developing a foundational understanding of data manipulation and API endpoints.
